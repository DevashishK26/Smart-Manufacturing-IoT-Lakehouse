# Smart-Manufacturing-IoT-Lakehouse
End-to-end Smart Manufacturing Lakehouse built on Databricks using Medallion architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold). Ingests synthetic IoT and operational data, applies data quality rules, builds a star schema, simulates row/column-level security, and optimizes Delta tables with ZORDER. Fully orchestrated, modular, and re-runnable.
